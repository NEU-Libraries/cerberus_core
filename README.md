CerberusCore
-------------

This project is an attempt to take the general backend architecture of the DRS [here](http://www.github.com/neu-libraries/drs) and generalize it into its own gem, which will then be usable as the basis for (hopefully most or maybe just some) of the other Heads we create that hook into the Library's Fedora instance. 

Installation instructions and the like forthcoming - I personally wouldn't recommend you try to use this for anything at the moment.
